| Category                     | Metric/Information                     | Value/Details                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **1. Acoustical Phenomena**  |                                        |                                     |
| Occupational Exposure Limit  | 8-hour TWA (Time Weighted Average)     | 85 dBA (OSHA standard)              |
|                              | Maximum Peak Sound Level               | 140 dBC                             |
| Non-occupational Exposure    | Entertainment Venue Limit (EU)         | 100 dBA averaged over 4 hours       |
|                              | Recovery Time Needed                   | 16+ hours after exposure to 100 dBA |
| Common Over-exposure Sources | Club/Concert Average                   | 95-110 dBA                          |
|                              | Personal Audio Devices                 | Up to 110 dBA at max volume         |
| Anatomical Impact            | Hair Cell Recovery Period              | None - damage is permanent          |
|                              | Distance to Damage (100 dBA source)    | Within 15 meters                    |
|                              | Temporary Threshold Shift              | 24-48 hours recovery                |
|                              | Permanent Threshold Shift              | Occurs at >85 dBA (8hr)             |
| **2. At-Risk Populations**   |                                        |                                     |
