# Abstract

Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized our understanding of musical expertise[^1]. This comprehensive review examines the neural correlates of musical training, focusing on structural and functional brain changes observed in professional musicians[^2]. Through meta-analysis of 157 studies conducted between 2010 and 2024, we present evidence for experience-dependent plasticity in auditory, motor, and executive function networks.

# Introduction

The acquisition of musical expertise represents one of the most complex forms of human skill development[^3]. Professional musicians typically begin training early in life, accumulating over 10,000 hours of deliberate practice by early adulthood[^4]. This intensive training regimen leads to remarkable behavioral adaptations, including enhanced auditory discrimination, superior motor control, and improved cognitive flexibility[^5].
