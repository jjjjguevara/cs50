            <title>Wave Motion</title>
            <p>Sound propagates through elastic media as a longitudinal wave, where particles oscillate parallel to the direction of wave travel. The speed of sound varies depending on the medium's properties.</p>

            <title>Propagation Speed</title>
            <p>Sound travels at different speeds through different materials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Air (20Â°C): approximately 343 meters per second</li>
                <li>Water: approximately 1,481 meters per second</li>
                <li>Steel: approximately 5,120 meters per second</li>
            </ul>

            <title>Factors Affecting Propagation</title>
            <p>Several factors influence sound propagation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Temperature:</b> Higher temperatures increase propagation speed</li>
                <li><b>Density:</b> Affects the speed and efficiency of sound transmission</li>
                <li><b>Humidity:</b> Influences sound absorption in air</li>
                <li><b>Wind:</b> Can bend sound waves and affect perceived direction</li>
            </ul>
