            <title>What is Sound?</title>
            <p>Sound is a mechanical wave that results from the back and forth vibration of the particles of the medium through which the sound wave is moving. Most commonly, this medium is air, though sound can travel through any material medium.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Vibration:</b> The source of all sound is a vibrating object</li>
                <li><b>Medium:</b> The material through which sound travels</li>
                <li><b>Wave Motion:</b> The transfer of energy through the medium</li>
                <li><b>Reception:</b> The detection and interpretation of sound waves</li>
