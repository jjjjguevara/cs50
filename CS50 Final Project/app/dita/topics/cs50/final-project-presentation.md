# Introduction

## Developer tools

This project is being developed in [Zed IDE](https://zed.dev/) with assistance of the [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://anthropic.com) large language model from Anthropic Inc., as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control.

## Third-party code and libraries

Our main codebase and processing logic are original, but they rely on crucial resources such as:

- [Bootstrap 5.3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)
- [DITA Open Toolkit](https://www.dita-ot.org/)
- [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
